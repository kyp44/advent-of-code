//! Potentially exhaustive search of a tree structure.
//!
//! Provides traits that can be implemented by tree nodes to enable recursive searches
//! of the tree. The different traits have different goals and provide different results when
//! searching the tree. Tree search capability is added by implementing one of the node
//! traits on tree node items, which can then spawn child nodes into which the search
//! algorithm will recurse.
//!
//! Examples of problems amenable to tree structures including one or multiplayer game trees,
//! optimally solving a problem with a particular goal using a brute force search, etc.
//! Refer to AOC problem solutions that utilize this module for more examples.
