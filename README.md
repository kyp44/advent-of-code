## Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems in Rust.
I am working through these to help me learn Rust and because the problems are fun to solve!

All the code is documented to some extent, including general utilities in the [aoc] module
that are used in multiple solutions.

Also see the LaTeX notes for problems that required more analysis.
The document is in the `notes` directory and includes a `Makefile`.
