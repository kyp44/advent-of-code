# advent-of-code

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems in Rust.

I started this to help me learn Rust, but now the problems are just fun to solve and also help keep my Rust skills sharp!
All the code is documented to some extent, including general utilities in the [`aoc`] module
that are used in multiple solutions.

Also see the LaTeX notes for problems that required more analysis or warranted further explanation.
The document is in the `notes` directory and includes a `Makefile`.
